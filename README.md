# GitHub-Repos-Listing
## About
This is a project born from the Geek University JavaScript course.
It is a Web Application that accesses the GitHub APIs and list the user's searches, for GitHub repositories or Users.
The idea is to use only JavaScript - no JS frameworks - to better understand the programming language, its features and applications in webdevelopment, while accessing external data from APIs and using additional tools such as Webpack and Babel.

## Development Diary

Initializing the project:
* Configuring Webpack and Babel;
* Initial HTML configuration - to be changed as project's implementation changes;
* CSS configurations - Extra styling.

### Aug, 17th
* Repos listing is now dynamically filled;
* Accessing GitHub API to fetch repos;
* Error handling added (trying to access non-existing repo);
* Data is being persisted in localStorage;
* User can remove a repo from the listing.

## TODO
* Further error handling (trying to add a repo that is already listed).
