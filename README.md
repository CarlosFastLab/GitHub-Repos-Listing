# GitHub-Repos-Listing
## About
This is a project born from the Geek University JavaScript course.
It is a Web Application that accesses the GitHub APIs and list the user's searches, for GitHub repositories or Users.
The idea is to use only JavaScript - no JS frameworks - to better understand the programming language, its features and applications in webdevelopment, while accessing external data from APIs and using additional tools such as Webpack and Babel.

## Development Diary
